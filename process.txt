- I decided to turn my project from CS50P to Javascript so that it can be interactive and playable

- I first needed to get the size right when it opened so I started with startscreen and when I uploaded
  it without the transform lines in style.css it was huge

- I realize when I made my game in Python, I named the photos things that didn't make sense so I'm going to change those

- I'm going to try to make the intro not as long by going over text again and limiting frames

- I realize that when I made this game before, I actually drew text directly on the background of some of the terminal screens,
  which made managing a ton of jpg photos kind of a mess, so this time I'm cutting back what would have been over 14 background images
  down to about 8 AND I'm going to randomize a list of text for the top and bottom of the background
  screens. This seems like a big improvement even if I have to change a bit of code now, good thing
  I decided this early on.

- I've updated the termial background art and added them to project/assets/backgrounds/

- I'm considering changing the narrative a bit to make more sense

- At this point I came back to my code after changing some backgrounds and realized I was a bit off course and deicded to clean up my code and
  go over it line by line so far to realy make sense of what I have so far and to organize it

- I thought compiling them all into seperate backgrounds was a good idea, but that's what I did in Python, and there had to be a better way
  then constantly makiing seperate actions for every single background

- I used : outline: 2px dashed rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8); to check where my click spots were on the home screen and will use this idea for the
  remaining button areas I need to make

- In the game.js document object model, I was using snake case but I'm changing to camel case because it mkaes more sense in Javascript

-I came back to my code and realized that trying to manage the style as well as the advancement of the game was a getting a bit muddy, so I'm
  focusing on game progression for now, not style

-Now understanding the importance of checking ";" instead of "," .. a couple hours later

-I decided right now to just stick with a funny text based game just to make sure the mechanics work, before focusing on the visuals tomorrow.
 I'm looking forward to that.

-I added features for certain names entered like David Malan, David J. Malan, Elon, Jeff (this one is funny), and Marvin
-I added two features that instantly end the game abruptly

-I fixed a few endings, and I decided to incorporate achievements and keep track of how many times the user playst the game.
-Organizing my files is super important

-seeing this come together is really exciting! I debugged all day and probably got carried away with extra features.

-having tourlb eiwht title screen overlapping the intro because of all my different starting points

-https://ishadeed.com/article/custom-scrollbars-css/ < customizing scrollbar

-AAH the whitespace was being counted as indentation!!!!! HOURS later..

- finally got it working and tested every outcome and feature! Now I'll attempt to upload my own art into my game
